# Uraeda

Uraeda is a git-driven, opinionated software development harness. Humans write proposals, agents
research, ask questions, and write specs, plans, and tasks, and every step is checkpointed as plain
text in git. The project is early: most of it is still design documents.

## Constitution

Read `specs/CONSTITUTION.md` before any work. It holds the project's principles, ordered by
priority: when two conflict, the higher one wins. Its MUST and SHOULD rules are binding, and any
conflict with them must be resolved by a human.

## Understanding the workflows

- `README.md`: the workflow design. Read "Files organization" for the `specs/` layout and the
  decision ledger, and "Feature flow" for the steps from proposal to implementation.
- `specs/PRIORITIES.md`: what is being worked on now, next, and later.
- `TODO.md`: open design questions, each with a recommendation awaiting human review. Treat them as
  undecided.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown,
Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend
tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through
`vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for
information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a
`vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do
different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the
project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+ release. Add a tool name
to select part of the graph. For example, run `vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the
local `vite-plus` package. Use `vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation,
      run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include
      its output when asking for help.
