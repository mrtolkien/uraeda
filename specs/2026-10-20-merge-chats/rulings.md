# Rulings: Merge chats and changes

The low-impact choices made while planning and building [the plan](plan.md), inside the limits of
[the spec](spec.md) and the decisions. None binds future work: those are decisions.

## R1: A dropped worktree says where it stays

- **Decision**: `Dropped.worktree` is an `Option<Left>`, the worktree's path with why it stays, not
  the plan's `Option<WhyLeft>`. Besides the spec's "Its worktree has uncommitted changes: it stays
  at <path>", the drop says "Its worktree is locked", "You are in its worktree", and "Its worktree
  is outside .worktrees/", each followed by ": it stays at <path>".
- **Rationale**: the spec's sentence names the path, and `WhyLeft::Changes` has none; the shared
  worktree step of `clean` already returns a `Left`. The other reasons are the ones `ura clean`
  leaves a worktree for, and the spec gives them no text.
- **Alternatives considered**: rebuilding the path as `.worktrees/<folder>` in the API: wrong for a
  worktree checked out elsewhere.
- **If wrong**: one field type and four sentences, in `actions/drop.rs` and `api/drop.rs`.
- **Where**: task 2, `crates/core/src/actions/drop.rs`, `crates/core/src/api/drop.rs`.

## R2: A drop commits the priorities only when they had no other change

- **Decision**: the drop removes the entry, then commits `PRIORITIES.md` alone, as "Add and commit"
  does: when the file had uncommitted changes before, or a hook refuses the commit, the removal
  stays written, uncommitted, for the commit bar. An item no entry links is dropped without a
  commit.
- **Rationale**: the human's uncommitted edits to the priorities are work in progress, never
  committed by a tool on its own (`add_alone`'s rule); refusing the drop for them would block it
  over an unrelated edit.
- **Alternatives considered**: refusing the drop while the priorities have changes: blocks it for an
  edit that does not touch the entry; committing the whole file: commits the human's edits.
- **If wrong**: the drop's commit step, in `remove_entry` of `actions/drop.rs`.
- **Where**: task 2, `crates/core/src/actions/drop.rs`.
