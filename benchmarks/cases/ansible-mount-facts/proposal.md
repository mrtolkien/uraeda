# Title

Mount information cannot be gathered from most of a host's mount sources

## Description

A POSIX host records its mounts in more than one place, and the places disagree. Some mounts appear
only in static configuration, some only in the live mount table, and on platforms that keep neither
in a file the only account of them is what the `mount` command prints. Each of those is written in
its own format, and the formats differ across Linux, Solaris, the BSDs and AIX.

Only part of that account can be gathered. What is reported covers the live mount table of the local
host and leaves out the rest: nothing lets a caller say which of those sources to read, and nothing
reads the formats that are not the local one, so a mount recorded only in a Solaris or an AIX file,
or reported only by the mount command on a BSD host, cannot be obtained at all.

There is no control over the result either. Mounts cannot be restricted to particular devices or
filesystem types, and nothing bounds how long a slow or unresponsive mount point may hold up the
caller.

## Requirements

- Running the new `mount_facts` Ansible module must report the filesystem mounts of a POSIX host.

- The module must accept the parameters `sources` (list of str, default null), `mount_binary` (raw,
  default `"mount"`), `devices` (list of str, default null), `fstypes` (list of str, default null),
  `timeout` (float, default null), `on_timeout` (str, one of `error`/`warn`/`ignore`, default
  `error`), and `include_aggregate_mounts` (bool, default null).

- Calling the module's argument-specification helper must return that specification as a dict.

- The `sources` parameter must accept the aliases `all`, `static` and `dynamic`, a literal file
  path, and the literal value `mount`.

- `static` must resolve to `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/vfstab` and `/etc/filesystems`, in that order.

- `dynamic` must resolve to `/etc/mtab`, `/proc/mounts` and `/etc/mnttab`, in that order.

- `all` must resolve to the dynamic files followed by the static files.

- Under `all`, the mounts emitted from the dynamic sources must come before the mounts emitted from
  the static sources.

- When `sources` is null, the module must resolve it the same way as `["all"]`.

- A literal file path, and the literal `mount`, must be carried into the resolved list unchanged.

- Resolving the user sources `["static", "/etc/fstab"]` must produce
  `["/etc/fstab", "/etc/vfstab", "/etc/filesystems", "/etc/fstab"]`.

- When any entry in `sources` is an empty string, the module must fail with the message
  `sources contains an empty string`.

- When the resolved source list contains the same entry more than once, the module must emit exactly
  one warning.

- The text of that warning must be
  `mount_facts option 'sources' contains duplicate entries, repeat sources will be ignored: <resolved_sources_list>`,
  with the list rendered by its default repr.

- A source already read, or one whose symlink target has already been read, must be skipped, and
  skipping it must not produce a warning of its own.

- A file source must be read, and reported as its source, under the path exactly as it appears in
  the resolved list, even when that path is a symlink (`/etc/mtab` stays `/etc/mtab`); its symlink
  target is used only to recognise a source that was already read.

- A file source must be parsed by trying a `/etc/vfstab` parser, then a `/etc/mnttab` parser, then
  an `/etc/fstab` parser, then an AIX `/etc/filesystems` parser, and using the first one that
  succeeds.

- A column-based parser must not succeed on input containing a non-comment, non-blank line with
  fewer fields than its format requires, so that such input, AIX stanzas included, is handed to the
  next parser.

- The `/etc/fstab` parser must yield, per mount, a dict whose `device`, `mount`, `fstype` and
  `options` keys come from the first four whitespace-separated fields of each non-comment, non-blank
  line.

- When an `/etc/fstab` line carries a fifth and a sixth field, that dict must also carry integer
  `dump` and `passno` keys taken from them.

- The `/etc/vfstab` parser must yield, per mount, a dict with the keys `device`, `device_to_fsck`,
  `mount`, `fstype`, `passno`, `mount_at_boot` and `options`.

- A vfstab `passno` must be converted to an int when it is numeric, and left as the original string
  otherwise, as with `"-"`.

- The `/etc/mnttab` parser must yield, per mount, a dict with the keys `device`, `mount`, `fstype`,
  `options` and an integer `time`.

- Input counts as mnttab when at least one of its lines carries a ten-character timestamp column,
  and input where no line does must be rejected.

- Once mnttab input is accepted, every one of its lines must be parsed, including a line whose own
  timestamp column is shorter.

- The AIX `/etc/filesystems` parser must group the file into one stanza per mount point.

- In AIX `/etc/filesystems` content, a line beginning with `*` is a comment.

- Each AIX stanza must yield a dict with the keys `mount`, `device`, `fstype` and `attributes`,
  where `attributes` holds every `attr = value` pair in the stanza.

- A stanza's `fstype` must be taken from its `vfs` attribute.

- When a stanza does not yield a `device` or an `fstype`, each missing one must default to
  `"unknown"`.

- A stanza's `device` must be derived from its `nodename` and `dev` attributes, joined as
  `nodename:dev` when both are present.

- The line recorded for an AIX stanza must be the stanza's own lines joined by a newline, each kept
  exactly as it appears in the file including its leading whitespace, with comment and blank lines
  left out.

- Content that is not AIX-style, such as a Linux `/etc/filesystems` listing filesystem type names,
  must yield no entries.

- When `sources` contains the literal `mount`, or when a dynamic source is requested and no dynamic
  source yields a mount, the configured `mount_binary` must be run to collect mounts.

- When `mount_binary` is null, the run triggered by a dynamic source yielding no mounts must be
  skipped, while a literal `mount` entry in `sources` must still run it.

- The mount-binary fallback's entries must be emitted after every entry emitted from a file source,
  never before or interleaved among them.

- The mount binary must be located through the module's bin-path lookup, and when it cannot be found
  the module must fail with a message of the form
  `Failed to find required executable "<name>" in paths: ...`.

- The `mount_facts` Python module must import `os` and `subprocess` at module level, so that they
  are reachable as `mount_facts.os` and `mount_facts.subprocess`.

- Every external command the module runs, the mount binary and the UUID lookups alike, must be run
  by calling `subprocess.check_output` through that module-level `subprocess` name at call time,
  with its output handled as text, rather than through the `AnsibleModule` command runner.

- Listing `/dev/disk/by-uuid` and resolving symlink targets must likewise call `os.listdir` and
  `os.path.realpath` through that module-level `os` name at call time.

- Mount binary output must be obtained through `run_mount_bin`, and partition UUIDs through
  `get_partition_uuid`, each looked up as a module-level name when called.

- The mount binary must be run with its resolved path string itself as the command, not wrapped in a
  list.

- When the mount binary exits non-zero, the module must fail with
  `Failed to execute <resolved_path>: Command '<resolved_path>' returned non-zero exit status 1`.

- When the mount binary times out, the message reported must be
  `Command '<resolved_path>' timed out after <N> seconds`.

- Parsing the mount binary stdout must detect on its own whether the output is Linux-style,
  BSD-style or AIX-style.

- A Linux-style line must be read as `<device> on <mount> type <fstype> (<options>)`.

- A BSD-style line must be read as `<device> on <mount> (<fstype-and-options>)`, where the
  parenthesised group is split at its first comma, with surrounding whitespace stripped from both
  parts, into `fstype` and `options`: `(ufs, local, soft-updates)` gives `fstype` `ufs` and
  `options` `local, soft-updates`.

- A BSD-style line whose parenthesised group holds no comma must yield that whole group as `fstype`
  and must carry no `options` key at all.

- In AIX-style output the first two header lines must be ignored.

- An AIX-style line must yield the keys `device`, `mount`, `fstype`, `time` and `options`, where
  `time` is the date column kept as the string it appears as and `options` is the rest of the line
  kept verbatim, including its internal spacing.

- When an AIX-style line carries a non-empty node column, that node must be joined to the device as
  `node:device`.

- Mount binary output that is none of those three shapes must yield no entries.

- Entries collected from the mount binary must report the literal `mount` as their source.

- Each parsed mount must become a result dict carrying the parsed fields at the top level plus
  exactly two further keys: `ansible_context`, whose value is a dict of `source` and `source_data`
  holding the source and the line the mount came from, and `uuid`, which is null when no UUID could
  be determined.

- For each mount that survives filtering, the mount point's disk usage statistics must be gathered
  and merged into that result dict, subject to the timeout handling below; when no statistics are
  returned, nothing is merged.

- A mount must be kept only when its `device` matches at least one `devices` pattern, or `devices`
  is null, and its `fstype` matches at least one `fstypes` pattern, or `fstypes` is null.

- The module must deduplicate by mount point through a step returning a
  `(mount_points, aggregate_mounts)` pair.

- `mount_points` must be a dict keyed by mount point holding the first occurrence of each, so that
  the first source and device win a collision.

- `aggregate_mounts` must be an empty list when `include_aggregate_mounts` is not truthy.

- When one source reports the same mount point more than once and `include_aggregate_mounts` is
  null, the module must warn about ignoring repeat mounts, naming the sources that repeat.

- The same mount point arriving from two different sources must not produce that warning, and
  neither must an explicitly true or false `include_aggregate_mounts`.

- On success the module must return an `ansible_facts` dict of the exact shape
  `{"mount_points": <dict>, "aggregate_mounts": <list>}`.

- When no mount is found, that output must be exactly
  `{'ansible_facts': {'mount_points': {}, 'aggregate_mounts': []}}`.

- The `timeout` parameter must bound how long each mount-information operation may take, the mount
  binary run and the mount-size gathering included.

- Each external command must receive the configured `timeout` unchanged, a value of `0.0` included
  (reported as `... timed out after 0.0 seconds`); non-positive values are rejected only at the
  module entry point.

- At the module entry point, a `timeout` that is neither null nor greater than zero must cause
  failure with the message `argument 'timeout' must be a positive number or null`.

- At the module entry point, a `mount_binary` that is neither null nor a string must cause failure
  with the message `argument 'mount_binary' must be a string or null, not <value>`.

- When an operation exceeds the timeout and `on_timeout` is `error`, which is also the unset
  default, the module must fail with the underlying timeout message: the one stated above for the
  mount binary, and `Timer expired after <N> seconds` for size gathering.

- When an operation exceeds the timeout and `on_timeout` is `warn`, the module must emit that
  timeout message as a warning and carry on with that operation's result left out.

- When an operation exceeds the timeout and `on_timeout` is `ignore`, the module must carry on
  silently with that operation's result left out.

- Resolving a partition UUID on Linux must consult the entries under `/dev/disk/by-uuid`, then the
  device and UUID pairs reported by `lsblk`, then a `udevadm` property query, in that order,
  returning the first UUID found or null.

- An entry under `/dev/disk/by-uuid` must be matched through its symlink target: it names the
  device's UUID when that target equals the device name exactly as it was given.

- The `lsblk` and `udevadm` steps must locate their binary through the module's bin-path lookup and
  be skipped when it is absent; `lsblk` lines without a UUID column must be ignored, and the
  `udevadm` UUID must be read from its `ID_FS_UUID=` line.

- The `lsblk`-based listing and the `/dev/disk/by-uuid` listing must each be memoized with a cache
  exposing a `cache_clear()` attribute.

- File contents must be read through `get_file_content`, and mount sizes gathered through
  `get_mount_size`, each looked up as a module-level name of `mount_facts` when called.

- When `sources` is null, the module must behave as if it were `["all"]`.

- Every external command the module runs, the mount binary and the UUID lookups alike, must be run
  by calling `subprocess.check_output` on the module-level `subprocess` name, rather than through
  the module's own command runner.

- Each of those command runners must be reachable as a module-level name, so that it can be replaced
  at runtime.

- The mount binary must be run with its resolved path as the whole command.

- A BSD-style line must be read as `<device> on <mount> (<fstype-and-options>)`, where the first
  comma-separated token is `fstype` and the remainder is `options`.

- For each mount that survives filtering, the mount point's disk usage statistics must be gathered
  and merged into that result dict, subject to the timeout handling below.

- An entry under `/dev/disk/by-uuid` must be matched through its symlink target: it names the
  device's UUID when that target is the device being looked up.

- The file-reading helper and the mount-size helper used while gathering must be reachable as the
  module-level names `get_file_content` and `get_mount_size`, so that they can be swapped at
  runtime.

- (a) a file parser must fail, not skip, on a non-comment line with too few fields so AIX content
  falls through; (b) AIX comment lines start with `*`; (c) merge size stats only when the helper
  returns a truthy dict; (d) compare the by-uuid symlink target to the device string as given.

- Read and label each file source by the path exactly as given (`/etc/mtab` stays `/etc/mtab` even
  when it is a symlink); resolve symlinks only to decide whether a source was already read.

- Mount-binary fallback entries carry the literal string `mount` as `ansible_context.source`.

- Command helpers pass the configured `timeout` to `subprocess.check_output` unchanged, including
  `0.0` (message `... timed out after 0.0 seconds`); only the entry point rejects non-positive
  values.

- Call `subprocess.check_output` and handle its result as `str`. Locate `lsblk` and `udevadm` with
  `module.get_bin_path`, skipping that step when the binary is absent; skip `lsblk` lines with no
  UUID column; read the udevadm UUID from the `ID_FS_UUID=` line.

- When mount-size gathering exceeds `timeout`, the message produced must be
  `Timer expired after <N> seconds` (for example `Timer expired after 0.1 seconds`), and that
  timeout is what triggers `on_timeout` handling: failure with that message by default, a warning
  with that message for `warn`, silence for `ignore`.

- On success call `module.exit_json(ansible_facts=...)` with `ansible_facts` as the only keyword
  argument.

- For a BSD-style line, split the parenthesised group at its first comma and strip whitespace from
  both parts: `(ufs, local, soft-updates)` gives `fstype` `ufs`, `options` `local, soft-updates`.

- The `os` and `subprocess` modules must be reachable as the module attributes `mount_facts.os` and
  `mount_facts.subprocess`, and the `check_output`, `listdir` and `realpath` functions must be
  looked up through `mount_facts.subprocess`, `mount_facts.os` and `mount_facts.os.path` at call
  time, so that replacing those attributes at runtime takes effect.
